# Cloud Image Tests #

The **Cloud Image Tests** are a testing framework and a set of test suites used
for testing GCE Images.

## Invocation ##

Testing components are built into a container image. The entrypoint is
`/manager`, which supports the following options:

    Usage:
    -machine_type string
    	sets default machine_type for test runs, regardless of architecture
    	prefer the use -x86_shape and/or -arm64_shape instead
    -arm64_shape string
    	default arm64 vm shape for tests not requiring a specific shape (default "t2a-standard-1")
    -x86_shape string
    	default x86(-32 and -64) vm shape for tests not requiring a specific shape (default "n1-standard-1")
    -zone string
    	zone to be used for tests
    -project string
    	project to use for test runner
    -test_projects string
    	comma separated list of projects to be used for tests. defaults to the test runner project
    -compute_endpoint_override string
    	use a different endpoint for compute client libraries
     -exclude string
    	skip tests matching filter
    -filter string
    	only run tests matching filter
    -gcs_path string
    	GCS Path for Daisy working directory
    -images string
    	comma separated list of images to test
    -local_path string
    	path where test binaries are stored
    -out_path string
    	junit xml output path (default "junit.xml")
    -write_local_artifacts string
    	Local path to download test artifacts from gcs. (default none)
    -parallel_count int
    	tests to run at one time
    -parallel_stagger string
    	parseable time.Duration to stagger each parallel test (default "60s")
    -set_exit_status
    	Exit with non-zero exit code if test suites are failing (default true)
    -timeout string
    	timeout for each step in the test workflow (default "45m")
    -print
    	instead of running, print out the parsed test workflows and exit
    -validate
    	validate all the test workflows and exit

The following flags are provided to the manager but interpreted by test suites when run, see the [the test\_suites documentation](test_suites/README.md) for more information.

    -shapevalidation_test_filter string
    	regexp filter for shapevalidation test cases, only cases with a matching family name will be run (default ".*")
    -storageperf_test_filter string
    	regexp filter for storageperf test cases, only cases with a matching name will be run (default ".*")
    -networkperf_test_filter string
    	regexp filter for networkperf test cases, only cases with a matching name will be run (default ".*")

It can be invoked via docker as:

    $ images="projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-10,"
    $ images+="projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9"
    $ docker run gcr.io/gcp-guest/cloud-image-tests --project $PROJECT \
      --zone $ZONE --images $images

### Credentials ###

The test manager is designed to be run in a Google Cloud environment, and will
use application default credentials. If you are not in a Google Cloud
environment and need to specify the credentials to use, you can provide them as
a docker volume and specify the path with the GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS
environment variable.

Assuming your application default or service account credentials are in a file
named credentials.json:

    $ docker run -v /path/to/local/creds:/creds \
      -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/creds/credentials.json \
      gcr.io/gcp-guest/cloud-image-tests -project $PROJECT \
      -zone $ZONE -images $images

The manager will exit with 0 if all tests completed successfully, 1 otherwise.
JUnit format XML will also be output.

## Writing tests ##

Tests are organized into go packages in the test\_suites directory and are
written in go. Each package must at a minimum contain a setup file (by
convention named setup.go) and at least one test file (by convention named
$packagename\_test.go). Due to golang style conventions, the package name cannot contain an underscore. Thus, for the test suite name to match the package name, the name of the test suite should not contain an
underscore. For example, if a new test suite was created to test image licenses,
it should be called imagelicensing, not image_licensing.

The setup.go file describes the workflow to run including the VMs and other GCE
resources to create, any necessary configuration for those resources, which
specific tests to run, etc.. It is here where you can also skip an entire test
package based on inputs e.g. image, zone or compute endpoint or other
conditions.

Tests themselves are written in the test file(s) as go unit tests. Tests may use
any of the test fixtures provided by the standard `testing` package.  These will
be packaged into a binary and run on the test VMs created during setup using the
Google Compute Engine startup script runner.

When writing tests to run against both Linux and Windows, it is preferred to
use separate functions within the same test where appropriate based on
differences between OSes (ex. powershell vs bash commands). This makes the
test definitions easier to read and maintain.

For example, if the test TestSomeCondition() needs to run different commands to
achieve similar results (and the test is located in the directory "mydefaulttest"):

```go

package mydefaulttest

import (
    "runtime"
    "testing"
)

func RunTestConditionWindows() {
    //Test something in Windows
}
func RunTestCondition() {
    //Test something in Linux
}

func TestSomeCondition(t *testing.T) {
    if runtime.GOOS == "windows" {
    RunTestConditionWindows()
    } else {
        RunTestCondition()
    }
}
```

Note that there are also functions available in the [test_utils.go](utils/test_utils.go)
for some OS level abstractions such as running a Windows powershell command or
checking if a Linux binary exists.

It is suggested to start by copying an existing test package. Do not forget to add
your test to the relevant `setup.go` file in order to add the test to the test suite.

### Modifying test behavior based on image properties ###

For tests that need to behave different based on whether an image is arm or x86, or linux or windows, it is preferred to use compute API properties rather than relying on image naming conventions. These properties can be found on the testworkflow Image value. The list of values can be found in the compute API documentation [here](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/compute/v1#Image). Some examples are in the following code snippet.

```go
func Setup(t *imagetest.Testworkflow) {
	if t.Image.Architecture == "ARM64" {
	//...
	} else if utils.HasFeature(t.Image, "GVNIC") {
	//...
	}
}
```

### Testing features in compute beta API ###

Tests that need to run against features in the beta API can do so by creating TestVMs using `CreateTestVMBeta` or `CreateTestVMFromInstanceBeta` to use the beta instance API. However, due to limitation with daisy's create instances step, if one instance in a TestWorkflow uses the beta API all instances in that workflow must use the beta API.


## Building the container image ##

From the root directory of this repository:

    $ docker build -t cloud-image-tests -f imagetest/Dockerfile .

## Testing on a local machine ##

From the `imagetest` directory of this repository, where outspath is
the folder where test outputs are stored:

    $ local_build.sh -o $outspath

By default, all test suites are built. To build only one test suite:

    $ local_build.sh -o $outspath -s $test_suite_name

To build from a directory other than `imagetest`

    $ local_build.sh -o $outspath -i $path_to_imagetest

To run the tests, cd into $outspath, set the shell variables and run

    $ manager -zone $ZONE -project $PROJECT -images $images -filter $test_suite_name -local_path .


## What is being tested ##

The tests are a combination of various types - end to end tests on certain
software components, image validations and feature validations, etc. The
collective whole represents the quality assurance bar for releasing a [supported
GCE Image][gce-images], and the test suites here must all pass before Google
engineers will release a new GCE image.

The tests are documented in [the test\_suites directory](test_suites/README.md).
